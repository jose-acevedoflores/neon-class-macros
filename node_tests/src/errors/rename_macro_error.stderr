   = help: message: Found an 'impl_block' argument for struct "TestStruct" but no constructor or methods were found.
           This could be because:
             1. none are implemented, in which case the 'impl_block' decoration can be removed.
             2. the 'neon_class' macro was renamed to something else. This is currently not supported.
